# Meesterproef
This repository contains all the files that we used for our O&O Meesterproef project. Our project was given to us by the student team Team Daedalus of TU Eindhoven. Their goal is to create a drone that can fly for a very long time without having to land with solar power. The eventual vision is to have the drone scout for forest fires and have the drone be able to do this for days or even weeks on end without touching the ground.
However the problem that Team Daedalus had with their current design was that the wings were not very strong and thus very prone to torsional forces. So the wings were very unstable in fligt and sometimes they would even start aggressively shaking and twisting. This was obviously not what you want to happen if you want the drone to be able to fly days or weeks on end. On top of that, the solar cells are eventually going to be on the wing, but they are very fragile, so the wing needed to be stronger and more stable to be able to carry solar cells.
So our project was to design a new drone wing from the ground up that is stronger and more resistant to torsional forces, so that the solar cells would never break when sat on top of the wings.
This repository contains all of the files and numeric models we used to simulate the forces in the wing and calculate how thick certain parts needed to be to withstand those forces.
